# Prediction Model Analysis
This project includes analysis and comparison of three prediction models used on the scikit-learn Wine dataset. 

## Data
The dataset was sourced from scikit-learn pre-loaded data sets, and can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine). The dataset consists of analysis results performed on Italian wines from the same region, but three different wineries. The attributes include variables of alcohol, malic acid, ash, alcalinity of ash, to name a few. This assignment primarily focues on the relationship between the alcohol, ash, and alcalinity of ash attributes. 


## Analysis
Three different machine learning models, perceptron, decision tree, and logistic regression, were utilized in this project. Each model prediction was analyzed and compared to its own prediction and model performance. Confusion matrices and classification reports were generated for each model. The decision tree classifier was also plotted in 2D and 3D with contours represending the prediction decision boundaries. All plots can be referenced below.
